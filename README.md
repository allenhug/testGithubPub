# To setup: 

1 Fork this repositoray to your account by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of this page. 

2 Clone the repository to your Mac or Linux machine using: 

cd $HOME

git clone git@github.com:yourGithubAccount/testGithubPub.git 

# Run from commandline: 

$HOME/testGithubPub/bin/push.command

# Run by clicking the icon on the Mac Dock

Go to Mac Finder, locate the file $HOME/testGithubPub/bin/push.command, drag it to Mac Dock. This adds an icon to dock so that you can click and push. 

# Auto close terminal when push finishes: 

The terminal may not close after push finish. To auto close it, open up the Terminal app from the Dock or your Applications folder, then open the settings by pressing Command+Comma.

In the Settings window, switch to the Profiles tab. The default profile (the one at the top) should be selected by default. In the settings on the right, click the “Shell” tab and then click the “When the shell exits” drop-down menu.

The drop-down menu defaults to “Don’t close the window,” but you’ll want to change this to “Close if the shell exited cleanly.”
